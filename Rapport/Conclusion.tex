\section{Conclusion}\label{Sect_Conclusion}
To summarize, we were able to develop a functional and practical model for December 2019 and thus delivered 2019 year end predictions to compare with the corporative actuarial department booked numbers. The results were potive and the model is mathematically simple and very interpretable. However, we were not fully satisfied with the model and wanted to increase accuracy and consistency. After a few months, we manage to even further reduct the error, although we still have some potential areas of improvement. The impuation method can be potentially improved by taking into acount the month of loss, the cause of missing values (accident type etc.) and other variables. Maybe simply removing the missing values for the factor calculation might be feasable. Systematic overestimation and underestimation depending on the region is our biggest concern and we still have to further investigate the cause. 
In addition, we might rapidly reach a limit for this simplistic model. We consider developping an more advanced machine learing model for a claim by claim prediction approach.
