\section{Introduction}
This winter I was working for the Data Lab of Intact Insurance. Specifically, I joined the Claims squad. The squad develops programs and models which are used internally for process optimization and cost reduction. Our team was mandated to develop a IBNR prediction model to validate the results of the existing model from the acturial department. Based on our analyisis of the data, we use a hiearchical approach, where we cluster the data into more homogentic groups. In addition, we do not use the typical chain-ladder method. Instead, we utilize the predictive power of key information such as the garage estimate or the market value of the vehicle. \\
The report is organised into four main sections. First, in section \ref{sect_objective} we provide the context of the project and its objectives. Then, we will deep dive into the dataset in section \ref{Section_dataAnalysis}. Next, in section \ref{Sect_Methodologie} we will discus our methodolgie for the model. Finally, we will show the results in section \ref{Sect_Results}.
