\section{Introduction}
This winter I was working for the Data Lab of Intact Insurance in the claims teams. The team develops programs and models which are used internally for process optimization and cost reduction. The claims team was mandated to develop an IBNR prediction model to validate the results of the existing model from the actuarial department. Based on the analysis of the data, we use a hierarchical approach, where we cluster the data into more homogenous groups. In addition, we do not use the typical chain-ladder method. Instead, we utilize the predictive power of key information such as the garage estimate or the market value of the vehicle. \\
The report is organized into four main sections. First, in section \ref{sect_objective} we provide the context of the project and its objectives. Then, we deep dive into the dataset in section \ref{Section_dataAnalysis}. Next, in section \ref{Sect_Methodologie}, we discuss the methodology for the model. Finally, we show the results in section \ref{Sect_Results}.
